## Author
Zachary Johnson

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech's number base conversion utility. It's capable of number base conversion through both division and subtraction. It is also capable of bitwise operations.

## Build Instructions
```bash
gcc -o assignment1 convert.c main.c 
./assignment1
```

## Test Results
Summary: 100/100 tests passed

## Notes
This assignment ended up being quite the challenge for me. I was already a bit rusty with my coding, so having to learn the intricacies of how C works while doing a more complex assignment like this was a bit of a struggle.

One of the biggest challenges for me was figuring out how the formatting of inserting variables into functions differed from my previous experience with Python and Java.
